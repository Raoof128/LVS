  # In a real production setup, we would serve frontend via Nginx
  # For this standalone setup, we can use a simple python server or just rely on the backend if it served static files
  # But the current setup assumes opening index.html directly or serving it.
  # Let's add a simple nginx container to serve the frontend for a true "production" feel.
